# FinModelPortfolioSimulator

This project focuses on the analysis and modeling of financial data, leveraging data from Alpha Vantage and the Kenneth R. French - Data Library. It provides insights into different expected return predicted by financial model, as well as portfolio strategies, including Zero Beta, Max Sharpe Ratio, and Min Variance portfolios.

## Data Sources:
- **Alpha Vantage:** Financial data is sourced from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/). To run the notebooks effectively, you will need to obtain an API key from Alpha Vantage. You can get your free API key [here](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key).
  
- **Kenneth R. French - Data Library:** Additional data sets were obtained from the Kenneth R. French - Data Library to complement the analysis. Visit the website [here](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html).

## Notebooks:
1. `data_cleaning_formatting.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook is focused on preparing and cleaning the data for analysis.
2. `Fin model simulator (Part 1).ipynb`: Contains part one of the financial modeling and analysis. (Focusing on stock's expected return)
3. `Fin model simulator (Part 2).ipynb`: Continuation of the financial modeling and analysis. (Focusing on portfolio optimization)

## Additional Files:
- `project_functions.py`: This file contains auxiliary functions used across the notebooks.
