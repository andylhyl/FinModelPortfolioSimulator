# FinModelPortfolioSimulator 📊

This project focuses on the analysis and modeling of financial data, leveraging data from Alpha Vantage and the Kenneth R. French - Data Library. It provides insights into different expected return predicted by financial model, as well as portfolio strategies, including Zero Beta, Max Sharpe Ratio, and Min Variance portfolios.
